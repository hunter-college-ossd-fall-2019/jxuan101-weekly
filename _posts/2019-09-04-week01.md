#### Why Take An Open Source Development Class?  
The main reason for my interest in taking an open source development class was for me to learn how to develop and contribute to open source projects on github and for projects in general in the workplace. Although I am currently unemployed, I am seeking to gain some valuable experiences in open source development and hopefully increase the strength of my profolio. My goal is to use the knowledge I hope to obtain from this class and develop/contribute enough on github to get noticed and employed for any internships or full-time positions by the end of the semester. Since I will only be attending Hunter College for two more semesters, inclusive of the current semester, I really have to step my game up if I want to have any chance in becoming employed in the near future.
