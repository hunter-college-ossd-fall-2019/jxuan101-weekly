#### How would I take my first step into Open Source?
As my first contributions to an open source project, I believe that it would be wise to first begin with making smaller scale contributions such as feature suggestions, fixing typos, or bug-fixing. However, later on in the course, I should be making bigger contributions like pull requests or start my own open source project. The kind of projects that I would be interested in and contribute to would be projects that I personally use often such as a Discord bot or an Indie game. The reason for this is because since I actually use their software almost daily, I have an understanding of the project's structures and make suggestions based on my usage of their programs daily.
