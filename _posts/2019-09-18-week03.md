#### My Take on Myths and Misconceptions of Open Source.
Link to Article: [10 things you should know about open source before you use it](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-open-source-before-you-use-it/)  
  
1. __It's not just for Linux.__  
   I already knew that open source is universal and not just limited to the Linux platform. More specifically, I knew about the existence of open source software such [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) on Windows long before I even discovered Linux. Although I have to admit that in the beginning, I didn't know that [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) was open source. But knowing that now makes open source even more captivating.
2. __It's not always free.__  
   I learned that just because something is open source doesn't necessarily mean that the application is free. Organizations such as [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) create and release open source projects but they also provide support and other features that include a price tag.
3. __It may or may not have support.__  
   I realized that community is one of the most important aspects of open source software. Because the software is open source, the community can come together to provide support for one another even if the software might not offer support options from the developers themselves. Such communities might include forums or references. This is what makes open source software so accessible because there's always help available from somewhere.
4. __You have full access to the source code.__  
   The term itself "open source software" already implies that everyone can have full access to the source code. The only confusion here might be the licenses that the source code adheres to. To my understanding, other than the terms and conditions outlined in the software's license, what I do with the source code is entirely up to me. 
5. __Open source is not just for programmers.__  
   It is obvious that just because a person is not a programmer doesn't mean that he/she can't use the open source software. The ability to read and modify the source code is not and should not be considered a requirement for using open source software. Browsers such as [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) is open source but no one, not even the developers, expect its users to be able to understand or modify the source code.
6. __You aren't breaking any laws by adopting open source.__  
   I was unfamiliar with the legality of using and adoption of open source software however, I have come to learn that the use of open source software does not actually break any intellectual property laws due to the **SCO** case being tossed out. I also didn't know what the **SCO** was before this so this knowledge enlightens me.
7. __You don't have to be an expert to use it.__  
   I have to admit that open source code felt intimidating to me and it still does. The fact that there are so many lines of code and incorporates multiple degree of languages makes me feel outclassed. However, with the applications itself, most are one of the easiest things to install and use simply because they usually come with an executable file that installs itself. Running the application is as easy as double clicking the icon.
8. __Most open source software is as reliable as its proprietary counterpart.__  
   Although some open source software I use are as reliable as its proprietary counterpart such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) as an alternative for Adobe Photoshop. However, I do believe that since most proprietary software are developed through the efforts of large and experienced groups of people with a sizable amount of funding, their softwares would be better than their open source counterparts.
9. __Freeware and shareware are not the same as open source.__  
   I am aware that freewares and sharewares exist separately from open source software. I use freewares such as [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) often but I am aware that the source code of [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/) is not openly available to consumers such as myself.
10. __You're probably already using it.__  
   Examples of open source software I am currently using are 
   * [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
   * [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/)
   * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
