#### Learning Git and Beginner in Contributing to Open Source
I did a class activity using Git for the first time today in my Open Source Software Development class. Unsurprisingly, Git is amazingly useful for managing and tracking repositories on Github. Git has simple and self-explanatory commands making it very easy to use even for beginners. Installation and setup also posed no difficulties at all. The class activity went smoothly. There were no problems completing the tasks given although it might have took a little bit of time for my team members to figure it out. I personally did not encounter any merge conflicts but I have learned how to resolve them.

This article enbodies all my personal worries and problems with getting into open source development. Like the author, I have always felt incompetent whenever I try to make a contribution to an open source software. I felt like my contributions would be rejected and that trivial contributions such as fixing typos might be too simple to be considered a worthy contribution. Reading about the author's journey as an amateur open source contributer inspires me to be brave when aspiring to become an open source contributer because everything counts, no matter how small. Not everyone can contribute to big projects in the beginning so starting small seems to be the ideal beginning for a beginner open source contributer such as myself.
