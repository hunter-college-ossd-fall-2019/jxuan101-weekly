## Git-ting Good With GitHub  
Over the past few weeks, I've come to learn that Git and GitHub are very useful and simple to use tools for developers such as myself. No matter how experienced of a programmer you are, I would recommend you to learn and start using Git and GitHub if you haven't already. It doesn't take much time to set up or learn the basics so it's never to late to get started. Throughout this week, I participated in even more Git and GitHub related team coursework and I learned that working together with others has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that I don't have to shoulder all the work myself and that we can have multiple brains working to solve a problem rather than one. The disadvantages are the difference in work pacing among team members and the deviation in the degree of communication. These problems could sometimes make or break a project if left unresolved because Git and GitHub relies heavily on communication. Overall, I personally believe that the advantages outweighs the disadvantages because the disadvantages can easily be resolved. I've learned many things about Git and Github and teamwork throughout the course so far and I'm excited for what the rest of the course holds.
