## Second Guest Speaker and Open Source Contributions
### Open Source Contributions
Hey hey what's shaking? I'm back again to tell you all about my very productive week. First I will tell you about my progress assimilating into the open source community. I'm still contributing local restaurants around me to OpenStreetMap but I also started looking towards contributing to other projects on GitHub. My very first GitHub project contribution was for a project called [TravelResources](https://github.com/unseen1980/TravelResources). TravelResources is not an application but rather a library of APIs and other resources that will help others looking to build a travel app. I discovered this repository while searching for good first issue labels on GitHub. The creator of the repository was looking for help from others to help maintain or add to his library. And since I knew about the existence of OpenStreetMaps as an open source map service, I thought that it would be listed as a part of his library. However, that was not the case so I decided that this would be an easy first contribution for me. I proceeded to fork the repository, clone it to my local machine, create a new branch, make the edits, and then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/unseen1980/TravelResources/pull/25). It just so happens that my pull request was merged right away and I was thanked by the owner. Despite my first contribution being quite simple, I still felt a sense of satisfaction and desire to do more. I'm still currently looking for more repositories on GitHub where I could do more simple edits and ultimately, one where I can contribute a bit of code preferably in C++. I'm still quite busy with midterms and the rest of my classes but I will try to make time for more open source contributions.
  
### Guest Speaker Bill Reyner
Bill Reyner, the Associate Director and Vice President at FactSet, visited my class on Thursday to speak about the Open Source environment in a corporate setting. Listening to Bill talk about the developmental progress of FactSet over the source of 20 years was very interesting. Bill also showed us evolution of the user interface of FactSet as it develops from using a shell interface to a modern html interface. One could easily tell how much work and growth the employees at FactSet facilitated over the years to come to where they are today. Bill also discussed how the company had starting to move towards the open source landscape. He discussed the advantages of open sourcing their projects and also the challenges that comes with doing so in a large corporate setting. I understand that switching to an open source directed approach especially for a large corporation like FactSet would obviously be a challenge but I'm glad they are doing their best with their open source initiatives. If they can accomplish this, they could spread their name and influence even further from just the financial market and they could garner even better relations with their users thus overall, helping the company grow.  
  
### Weekly Summary
  * Read Chapter 3, Git Branching, of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). I learned more about branching, branch management, workflows, and rebases.
  * Read Eric Raymond's [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html) to learn about Eric Raymond's story of how he utilized Linus Torvald's bazaar style of development to create a open-source project that resulted in a significant success story.
  * Made my first [contribution](https://github.com/unseen1980/TravelResources/pull/25) to TravelResources and continued surfing through GitHub for more good first issues.
  * More OpenStreetMap edits.
