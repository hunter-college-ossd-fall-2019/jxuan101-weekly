##  Getting to Know Wikipedia
### Learning to Edit on Wikipedia
I started to learn about Wikipedia this week as a part of my Open Source software course's curriculum. Students in the course are expected to make Wikipedia contributions in the form of edits soon so our task is to scout out potential candidates for our Wikipedia edits. Before I even did that, I played around in the [Wikipedia Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox) to become familiar with making Wikipedia edits. As I was scouting Wikipedia, I noticed that since almost anyone can edit Wikipedia pages, most pages are well written. However, every now and then when I go to a random Wikipedia article, there would be a message box from Wikipedia that states that the article lacks inline citations or other improvements that could be made to the article. Here is an example of such messages in the article for [Johannie Seale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Seale) as of November 06, 2019. My plan is to find an article where I could find more relevant sources for and contribute those.
### GitHub Progression
Recently on GitHub, I submitted another pull request to the project that I worked on in the previous week which is called [TravelResources](https://github.com/unseen1980/TravelResources). The pull request I submitted this week has not been merged as of now but you can find it [here](https://github.com/unseen1980/TravelResources/pull/33). It was another simple process being fork the project, update the README's currency APIs with [Open Exchange Rates API](https://openexchangerates.org/), commit the changes, push the changes onto master, and submit the pull request. Besides this project, I've additionally started looking at another project called [terminalfaker](https://github.com/syntaxseed/terminalfaker). I'm currently working on the issue found [here](https://github.com/syntaxseed/terminalfaker/issues/26). I asked to 
work on the issue and the owner replied with a yes. I asked for a few clarifications on the issue and I've derived a solution to the code but I'm still waiting for a second opinion from the owner before I submit a pull request for it. I certainly hope my inexperience didn't influence the owner into thinking I couldn't do it.
### Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert
After reading the article on ["Makers and Takers"](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source) by Dries Buytaert, I agree with his idea that the so called "Takers" hurt "Makers" by reaping and profiting off the benefits that Makers' Open Source contributions provide without contributing anything back thus Makers have to defend themselves through more selfish means bringing them closer to becoming Takers themselves. There is a clear advantage that Takers have financially speaking, because their focus is to make as much profit as they can first before giving back to the community. There must be a better alternative for the Open Source community so that they're not left behind and Buytaert offers some solutions especially for larger Open Source projects. To summarize, they are better self-governance, better privatization such as stricter licensing, and centralization of governance. All three solutions Buytaert listed sounds like great ideas and I agree with them. They might be more difficult to setup and manage and could be expensive, but they would certainly help Open Source projects take back control over their position in the Makers and Takers dynamic.
### Weekly Summary
  * Read an [article](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source) by Dries Buytaert discussing the issues and possible solutions to the position of Open Source in the business environment.
  * Learned more about Linux and bash commands.
  * Read [Contributing to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia#Getting_started) and [A primer for newcomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:A_primer_for_newcomers) in preparation to make Wikipedia edits very soon.
  * Submitted [pull request](https://github.com/unseen1980/TravelResources/pull/33) to [TravelResources](https://github.com/unseen1980/TravelResources).
  * Started on [issue](https://github.com/syntaxseed/terminalfaker/issues/26) on [terminalfaker](https://github.com/syntaxseed/terminalfaker).
