## A Slow Week
### Guest Speaker: Kevin Fleming from Bloomberg LP
This week, Kevin Fleming, a member of the CTO Office at Bloomberg LP, spoke at my Open Source development course about Bloomberg LP and their involvement with Open Source and how they're giving back to the Open Source community. I learned that the Bloomberg LP is a very active contributor to dozens of Open Source projects such as Jupyter and Hadoop. They also released some of their own Open Source projects. Bill Reyner, Associate Director and Vice President at FactSet, who also guest spoke in my class during week 8, mentioned that they did something similar when engaging with the Open Source community.  FactSet, despite being "Closed Source" for most of their earlier years, had recently started getting involved in Open Source. They released many of their own Open Source projects. However, Bloomberg goes a step beyond that and actually organizes Open Source events such as inviting creators to host events where they teach others on how to contribute to their project. I appreciate all the work they do and the role they play in the financial and Open Source communities.
