## Discussing Voting Fraud and GitHub Status
### Voting Fraud and Open Source

Whether you know it or not, voting fraud exists. Very recently, citizens who voted on the Mississippi Republican gubernatorial primary in August 2019 fell victims to voting fraud where the voting machine apparently "malfunctioned" and defaulted votes for candidate Bill Waller to his opponent, Tate Reeves. A video of the incident can be found [here](https://twitter.com/STaylorRayburn/status/1166347828152680449). For a machine whose job is to collect the votes of citizens and help determine the future of their community/country, one would figure that it would be exceedingly important for them to function properly and securely without bias. Sadly, it exists. However, the [OSET](https://www.osetfoundation.org/)(Open Source Election Technology) Institute is working hard to change the current landscape of voting technology with [ElectOS](https://trustthevote.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/electos_architecturetour.pdf), an Open Source election all-purpose tool. Personally, I think the future of America will depend on Open Source election tools such as ElectOS. Elections should be transparent and well secured and American citizens should have their vote count for whoever it is they vote for. If the government, local, state, or national, has nothing to hide, then secure Open Source elections shouldn't pose much of a problem. I wish OSET the best in finalizing and pushing out ElectOS before the next major elections.  
### GitHub Progression
As I mentioned in last week's [blog post](https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/jxuan101-weekly/week11/), I wanted to give the creator of [terminalfaker](https://github.com/syntaxseed/terminalfaker) some time to answer me back about my contribution but I think that is now a lost cause. This is why I will be focusing on a new project on GitHub called [AncientBeast](https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast). Ancient Beast is a turn based strategy indie game project that can be played online with other people. This project and its maintainers are much more active and there are a lot of recent documented issues to choose from. I have already [forked](https://github.com/jxuan101/AncientBeast) the repository and started familiarizing myself with the code and the gameplay. Soon, I will be picking an issue and ask to be assigned but for now, I have to play around with the project first.
